# Project Overview:
This project analyzes personal finances to evaluate financial habits. Over a 10-month period (January-October), it examines an individual's income and expenses, providing valuable insights into their financial habits.

# Data Overview:

Data source:
The dataset was sourced from Freedom Oboh, who guided this project.

Scope: The dataset covers Jan-Oct 2021. It includes fields like debit, credit, category, category type, month, net amount etc.

# Tool: 
- Excel: Used for data cleaning, analysis and dashboard creation.

# Methodology:

1. Data cleaning/preparation 
2. Exploratory data analysis: The following questions were addressed through this analysis:
   
- What is the total income and expenses for the period covered?
  
- What is the maximum amount credited and debited from the account?
  
- Which product category draws more expenses?
  
- which income source generates more money?
  
- How is money generated and spent weekly and monthly?

# Findings:

1. Total amount credited to the account was $65,440.
2. Total expenses made was $30,191.
3. The top-earning income source ($50,000) was Data with decision, while the least earning source was Teachable ($4,500).
4. Housing expenses (house rent) was the highest expense, with a total of $9,000, followed by Groceries ($6,454).
5. Most spendings were made on Tuesdays ($5,594), then on Fridays (5,051). The least spendings were made on Saturdays ($3,441).
6. The most income was generated on Mondays ($31,400), while the least was on Wednesdays ($100).
7. The top-earning month was January ($14,000).
8. May had the highest expenses (with total of $3,116 spent).

# Summary:
Now, to summarise the findings further, I will say that this person:

- Has a stable income.
- The total expenses made (which accounts for roughly 46% of the total income) are quite reasonable. The expenses were managed well.
- Has a significant amount of savings (54% of income).
  
In conclusion, this individual has a good balance between earning, spending and saving.

# Recommendations:

1. Negotiate a lower rent or explore alternative accomodations, as housing expense is quite high.
2. Draft a budget plan to reduce grocery expenses, which are the second-highest expense.
3. Implement strategies to reduce expenses on Tuesdays and Fridays as expenses are more on those days.
4. Create a monthly budget to track income and expenses, ensuring that expenses do not exceed income.
